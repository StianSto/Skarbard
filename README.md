Skårbård is an app for keeping score for whatever game you´re playing. The main point is to be able to the rules depending on what game you are playing. in some games the winner is the one with the most points, in others the one with the fewest. Skårbård lets you set these rules. It can also set conditions for when the game is over, for example after 12 turns or if a player goes over 66 points.
